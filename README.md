# CUDA Examples

To run these examples you'll need to run an interactive SLURM job on one of the Maxwell GPU nodes:

	$ salloc --partition=maxwell --account=sc3260 --time=2:00:00 --gres=gpu:1

This will give you one CPU core and one NVIDIA Titan X Maxwell GPU.

To build the examples make sure you have a recent version of CUDA loaded into your environment:

	$ setpkgs -a cuda7.5

To get information about the device (i.e. GPU) try running the following:

	$ /usr/local/cuda-7.5/samples/1_Utilities/deviceQuery/deviceQuery
